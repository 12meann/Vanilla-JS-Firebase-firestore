# Vanilla-JS-Firebase-firestore

A Movie List application where you can add a movie title, rating and choose a genre.

Just recently added a search movie and genre feature using vanilla JS

Using <strong> Materialize </strong> as the CSS framework, <strong> Vanilla JS </strong>for DOM manipulaton and <strong>Firestore </strong> as its database.

Just turn the app into a <strong> Progressive Web App. </strong>
